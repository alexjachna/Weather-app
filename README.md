# Weather-app

# https://alexjachna.github.io/Weather-app/

A basic JS weather app that uses an API to obtain weather information from around the world.

This repo contains a very basic form of a weather app, where the user is given an input field, where they can enter in a city, which in return, outputs its temperature, and other weather conditions.

First submission contains the basic form of HTML/CSS.

-----------------------

The second submission contains a fully functional app, that allows the user to input a city, which in return, gives the temperature and the status of given city.

-----------------------

Third submission includes the HTML/CSS of a custom settings menu, which contains options like display (dark mode and light mode), temperature (Celsius & Fahrenheit) and time (Date & Time)

-----------------------

Fourth submission includes all settings operable at a minimal state. Temperature measurement is accurate (using formula rather than API), but the date change uses current date, rather than obtaining the info for given city.

-----------------------

Fifth submission contains updated light/dark mode setting, with efficient/updated JavaScript to be able to easily update/add more elements to the dark/light mode scenes.
